# A Microservice Architecture Demo

* Demonstrates a design and code organization of a typical back-end microservice in a real-life cloud-native web application. 
* This approach combines the benefits of clean abstractions as in "Clean Architecture" style with the practicality of keeping cohesive software components
that tighly collaborate together as proposed in "Vertical Slices" architectural style. 
* It welcomes continuous architecture quality evaluation and makes the system redisign a commodity by allowing for straigthforward recombination of functionalities between microservices.
* Automated application code testing is at the core the software development process.
